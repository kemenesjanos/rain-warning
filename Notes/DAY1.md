# Day 1

This is the description of the 1. day.

## Plan

- Create the github repo
- Create the structure of the notes and the readme
- Define the scope of the project

## Scope

- Create a lambda and the necessary resources from terraform to fetch the weather for a city and sends an email if that day will be rainy.
- There should be a github action for deploying and an other for destroying the resources in aws.
- It should be secure.
- Use env vars for the city, email, time and the api keys.

## What I learned

- Github repo naming convention. Lower case with "-".
- [Readme template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template)
